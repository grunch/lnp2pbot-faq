# What is Lightning Network?

Lighting Network is a network of payment channels that works as a second layer protocol on the Bitcoin network, taking advantage of the property of writing smart contracts on its blockchain. It is a scalability solution that allows exponentially increasing the number of transactions and their speed by not needing on-chain confirmations, while drastically reducing network fees. Payments become instant and cost almost nothing.
