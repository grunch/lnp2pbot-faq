# How do I create a sell order?

The procedure is exactly the same as for the purchase order, substituting the `/buy` command for `/sell`&#x20;

You have to type the details of your order: `/sell [premium/discount]` without the special characters.&#x20;

Ex. /`sell 100000 50 usd "bank xyz"` I sell one hundred thousand sats at fifty dollars I charge by bank xyz Like with the buying orders, if there is any non-compatible variable, the bot will indicate it to you during the order creation process. Upon completion, it will be published on the exchange channel and will remain visible for a period of 23 hours.
