# How do I cancel a posted order?

If the order has not been taken, use the command `/cancel` in your chat with the bot.

The ID or identification number of your order appears just below the message of acceptance and publication of the same, and it is even indicated to you as an option to cancel it. If the order has been taken, you must initiate a cooperative cancellation.
