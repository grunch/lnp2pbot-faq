# How do I create a purchase order?

When chatting with `@lnp2pbot` you will find a menu button that will prompt you for the buying command: `/buy` To place an order, you must write your order details right after the command, like this:&#x20;

`/buy [premium/discount]` without the special characters.

Ex. `/buy 100000 50 usd "xyz bank"`&#x20;

Buy one hundred thousand sats at fifty dollars payment by xyz bank

Some purchasing order would look like this:&#x20;

Ex. `/buy 0 50 you see "bank xyz"` I buy fifty bolivars in sats -in this case the bot will calculate at the market rate- payment by bank xyz&#x20;

`Ex. /buy 0 10-100 pen "mobile payment"` I buy from 10 to 100 nuevos soles -in this case the seller will choose the amount to sell you in that range- payment by mobile payment&#x20;

`Ex. /buy 0 100 eur -3 "mobile payment"`

&#x20;I buy 100 euros discounting 3% -in this case the bot will calculate the market rate discounting or increasing the percentage you choose- payment by mobile payment If there is any non-compatible variable, the bot will indicate it to you during the order creation process. Upon completion, it will automatically be published on the exchange channel and will remain visible for a period of 23 hours.
